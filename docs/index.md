## Quick Start

We generate pre-built standalone binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux from the `release` branch.
These binaries are intended for non-development users who just want to run the application and modify a few configurations along the way.

You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/PisterLab/micromissiles-unity/releases/latest).

Follow the instructions below for your operating system to download and run the application.

### Windows

1. Download the zip file for Windows: `micromissiles-<version>-windows_x86_64.zip`.
2. Unzip the zip file. The zip file should contain a single directory called `micromissiles-<version>-windows_x86_64`.
3. In the `micromissiles-<version>-windows_x86_64` directory, run `micromissiles-<version>-StandaloneWindows64.exe`.

### Mac

1. Download the tarball file for Darwin: `micromissiles-<version>-darwin.tar.gz`.
2. Extract the tarball. The tarball should contain a single directory called `micromissiles-<version>-darwin`.
3. In the `micromissiles-<version>-darwin` directory, run the app file.
4. If you get a warning that Apple cannot check the application for malicious software:
   * Open `System Preferences`.
   * Navigate to `Privacy & Security`.
   * Click on `Open Anyway` to bypass Apple's developer check.

### Linux

1. Download the tarball for Linux.
2. Extract the tarball and run the executable.

## Basics

- Use the mouse and arrow keys (or `WASD`) to pan and rotate the camera.
- Use `L` to load a new simulation configuration.
- Use `R` to restart the simulation.
- Use `Space` to pause/resume the simulation.
- Use `ESC` to exit the application.

## Next Steps

- Read the [**Simulation Overview**](./Simulator_Overview.md) to understand the simulation physics, agent behaviors, and swarm algorithms currently implemented in the simulator.
- Familiarize yourself with the [**Keybinds and Controls**](./Keybinds_and_Controls.md) to navigate and interact with the simulation.
- Learn how to configure the simulation settings by reading the [**Simulation Configuration Guide**](./Simulation_Configuration_Guide.md).
- Contribute to the project by setting up the Unity project according to the [**Development Guide**](./Development_Guide.md).
