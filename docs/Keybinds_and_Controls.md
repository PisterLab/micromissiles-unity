| **Action**           | **Keybind**            | **Description**                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Increase Speed**   | **Left Shift (Hold)**  | Hold down the Left Shift key to move the camera faster.        |
| **Normal Speed**     | **Release Left Shift** | Release the Left Shift key to return to normal movement speed. |

### Simulation Controls

Manage the simulation state with these keybinds:

| **Action**                     | **Keybind**     | **Description**                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pause/Resume Simulation**    | **Space**       | Toggles between pausing and resuming the simulation.                                |
| **Restart Simulation**         | **R**           | Restarts the simulation from the beginning.                                         |
| **Toggle Configuration Panel** | **L**           | Opens or closes the configuration selector panel for adjusting simulation settings. |

### Camera Shortcuts

Quickly focus on specific swarms or centers of interest:

| **Action**                                 | **Keybind**       | **Description**                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Snap to Next Interceptor Swarm**         | **1**             | Cycles through interceptor swarms and snaps the camera to their centroid.  |
| **Snap to Next Threat Swarm**              | **2**             | Cycles through threat swarms and snaps the camera to their centroid.       |
| **Snap to All Agents Center**              | **3**             | Snaps the camera to the centroid of all agents.                            |
| **Follow Next Interceptor Swarm**          | **Ctrl + 1**      | Cycles through interceptor swarms and follows their centroid dynamically.  |
| **Follow Next Threat Swarm**               | **Ctrl + 2**      | Cycles through threat swarms and follows their centroid dynamically.       |
| **Follow All Agents Center**               | **Ctrl + 3**      | Follows the centroid of all agents dynamically.                            |

> [!TIP]
> Press the number keys (**1**, **2**, **3**) to snap the camera to the respective centroids. Hold **Ctrl** while pressing the number keys to follow the centroids dynamically.

### Additional Controls

Enhance your interaction with the simulation using these keybinds:

| **Action**                        | **Keybind**       | **Description**                                           |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Toggle Fullscreen (Windows)**   | **Alt + Enter**   | Toggles between fullscreen and windowed mode.             |
| **Toggle Auto-Rotate**            | **P**             | Enables or disables the camera's auto-rotate feature.     |
| **Quit Application**              | **Esc**           | Exits the simulation application.                         |

## Tips for Effective Navigation

- **Combining Controls**: Feel free to combine mouse and keyboard controls. For example, hold the **Left Shift** key while moving the camera forward with the **W** key for faster traversal.
- **Pausing for Adjustments**: Use **Space** to pause the simulation, allowing you to adjust camera angles or settings without interruption.
- **Exploring Swarms**: Utilize the camera shortcuts to quickly focus on different swarms or all agents.
- **Auto-Rotate**: Press **P** to enable auto-rotation of the camera around the current focal point. This feature can be combined with other camera controls for better 3D perspective.

Happy simming!
